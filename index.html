Dhoni has captained the most international matches and is the most successful Indian captain with wins in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy and the Asia Cup in 2010, 2016 and 2018.

Born in Ranchi, Dhoni made his first class debut for Bihar in 1999.
